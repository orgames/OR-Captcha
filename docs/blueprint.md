- Coin Award: Awards coins to the user upon successful Captcha validation.
- Balance Display: Displays the user's current coin balance.
- Rewarded Ads: Integrates rewarded video ads, allowing users to earn additional coins by watching them.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0D2EB) to create a calm, trustworthy feel.
- Background color: Light blue (#E2F3FF) to complement the primary color and maintain a clean interface.
- Accent color: Light green (#BCE29E) for indicating success or awarding of coins.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif, offering a modern yet friendly feel suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Simple, clean icons representing coins, ads, and captcha refresh actions.
- Clean and centered layout to focus the user's attention on the Captcha entry field and coin balance.
- Subtle animations upon successful Captcha validation and coin reward, like a coin appearing to 'drop' into the balance display.
